This works a little but needs some more work. I can build 4-deep UD, LR, FB centers staging
prune tables of a scrambled 4x4x4 cube and use those to IDA search from a solved
cube back towards the scrambled cube. At the same time you are doing IDA from scrambled
to solved and when the two trees cross you have a solution.  It does work, the problem
is you have to build prune tables specific to each cube which kinda sucks.

I tried doing bidir to solve all 4x4x4 centers in one shot but it was taking
forever, probably becuase I only built centers staging tables 4-deep (for the scrambled
cube).  I could build centers solving tables all the way but they are 54 million entries
each and take hours to build.

So for this to be feasible it needs to somehow work without building custom prune tables
for every scrambled cube.
